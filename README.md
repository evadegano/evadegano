### Hi, I'm Eva! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a freshly graduated software engineer from Ironhack. 

As a Project Manager in Digital Marketing and E-Commerce for over 4 years, I realized that the tech behind the products I was working on was what I was truly passionate about. Plus, I have always had a knack for improving and automating processes.
